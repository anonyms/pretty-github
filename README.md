Making my GitHub contributions view pretty


Pretty pointless stuff really, just wanted to try doing it through Genai Chat bots, all code written through them, with some very minor tweaks I just did without going through them.


Remember to docker build with arguments

```console
docker build --build-arg GIT_USER="username" --build-arg GIT_EMAIL="email" -t make-commits .  
```
